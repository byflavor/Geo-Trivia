            <h1>The Best, Most Wonderful Geography Quiz Page Ever!!!</h1>
            <h4>Navigate over to the study page to learn more about geography
            or take the quiz without studying (wow!) if you're feeling 
            extra confident...
            
            The rules are quite simple: you have up to three chances to 
            take your geography quiz, after which you will be locked out.
            However, if you score more than 70% on your first or second 
            try, you have passed and need not try another time.
